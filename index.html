	<h1>Women's Evolution</h1>
	<p>
		A year ago WWE introduced 3 new women wrestlers into the main roster.  They were Sasha Banks, Charlotte, and Becky Lynch.  They had spent a couple of years at the NXT. NXT is the developmental division that WWE owns to recruit and train wrestlers.  While at NXT, these 3 women along with another wrestler named Bayley, were known as The 4 Horsewomen.

		Up until this point, women's matches were getting 3-4 minutes with very little story telling.  They were considered the bathroom break matches.  But these new NXT women were finally given the chance to learn movesets like the men and they started putting on amazing matches.  A year ago, Sasha Banks and Bayley had 2 matches at 2 separate PPVS where they headlined the shows and had the match of the night.

	<p>
		<h3>Currently the women's roster is split into the two brands at WWE:</h3> Smackdown Live and RAW.
			<ul><strong>RAW</strong>
				<li>Charlotte</li>

				<li>Nia Jaxx</li>
				<li>Bayley</li>
				<li>Summer Rae</li>
				<li>Alicia Fox</li>
			</ul>

			<ul><strong>Smackdown Live</strong>
				<li>Becky Lynch</li>
				<li>Natalya</li>
				<li>Naomi</li>
				<li>Alexa Bliss</li>
